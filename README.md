# Fake-News-Analysis-using-NLP-in-R
In this era of technology content such as fake news or fake reviews can be really deceptive and highly dangerous for online users. Fake news can create havoc while fake reviews can impact consumers and stores negatively. The objective of this project is to build different algorithms that can flag a content based only on its content. By doing so, natural language processing (NLP) will be used to detect the fake news or review. One of the important goal is to compare the results from different model algorithms and report an analysis of findings. In this project, 3 different classifiers are explored and results are presented.
